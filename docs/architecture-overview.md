# Technical Architecture Overview

The AI Infrastructure Agent is a sophisticated infrastructure-as-code system that combines Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities with AWS resource management through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It provides both programmatic and web interfaces for managing cloud infrastructure using natural language requests while maintaining safety through comprehensive conflict detection, state management, and execution planning.

The system is architected as a multi-layered application written in Go, supporting multiple AI providers (OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude) and implementing enterprise-grade features including dry-run execution, real-time monitoring, dependency resolution, and conflict detection.
